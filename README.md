A resource-management click-game about plums with ridiculously over-the-top 3D graphics.
So it's like the fantastic [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/), except not as good, they're plums, you're not a rogue AI, and your device gets hotter because of WebGL running.

Another Creative Coding special at the Recurse Center. This week's prompt was:

    I have eaten
    the plums
    that were in
    the icebox

    and which
    you were probably
    saving
    for breakfast

    Forgive me
    they were delicious
    so sweet
    and so cold
